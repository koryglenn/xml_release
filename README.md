Releses of the XML GUI
This project was completed several years ago.  Matthew Ramsey (matthewlramsey@gmail.com) a co-op from Georgia Tech at the time, did the coding while I acted as the product lead and manager.  
The goal was to create an enhanced channel link in a UI of our Cable Set Top boxes when a new guide product deployed but didn't include the features of the previous client.
This repository contains the last two releases of the tool that were produced.  The latter being used for nearly a decade before decommissioning the guide client.
